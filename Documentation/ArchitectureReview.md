Architecture Review

1. Background and context

We want to make a single player RPG that the player would roam around like a platformer. The player is knight exploring the fallen castle to find the evil king. There will be various enemies that can react in small ways to the actions of the player and a boss fight that will be tied to player actions.

2. Key questions

-How should we go about approaching AI for enemies, specifically a boss level?

-Which aspects/add ons would be engaging for players?

-This is a long project that weâ€™re embarking on, are there any other extension goals you would like to see us attempt?     
(Ex: Have the music change tempo when there are more enemies)

3. Agenda for technical review session

-Explanation of our game
-What we have accomplished so far
  
  -Basic layout of the tutorial map
  
  -Block representation of the player
  
  -Keyboard commands
  
  -Scrolling window

-Feedback from other groups + ask for form submissions
